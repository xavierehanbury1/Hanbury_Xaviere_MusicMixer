# Music Mixer Project - Yodelers
# Xaviere Hanbury's Site 
 A website that is currently being used to provide a demonstration of drag and drop functionality, namely related to being able to drag icons of singing people into designated boxes so the combined sounds of various royalty free yodeling can be heard playing on the page. The site will largely focuses on the practicality of the drag and drop rather than the visual end of the spectrum, though graphical elements will still of course be prevalent.
